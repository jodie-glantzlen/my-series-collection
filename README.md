# Fullstack Collection App

This is a minimalist app I created to practice the full stack cycle and CRUD operations. 
You can add, update or delete a series from your collection and those changes will be saved in the database.

To use it, please do the following:

```
npm install
npm run knex migrate:latest
npm run knex seed:run
npm start
```
Note: I used a boilerplate repo from the Dev Academy Github org, which explains older commits from teachers.
